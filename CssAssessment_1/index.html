        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><b style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not necessary</b> <b style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work</b>.It can control the layout of multiple
            web pages all at once</li>
        <li><u>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</u></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>CSS can be addes to HTML Documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul id="id1">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an exrenal CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most commin way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS files. However, <b><span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorial we will

        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the
        other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link
        directly to an elementand it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.</p><br>
